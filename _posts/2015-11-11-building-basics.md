# Tipi building

## Selecting materials

### Poles

The type of poles you use will contribute to the total weight, as well as determine the strength and flexibility of the underlying structure.

The size of the poles can vary, but they will generally be from 20-30ft in length and you should expect to use between 15 and 20.

The best poles will be thicker at the bottom than the top, ideally almost double. 4in on the ground and 2in where they tie together.

 - Red Cedar
 - White Cedar
 - Pine

### Canvas

The canvas choice will determine the function of your tipi.  Most traditional tipis were made from tanned buffalo or deer hide.  This was very light in color and let a lot of light in during the day.  Dark canvas can make the inside of the tipi unnecessarily dreary.

If you decide to go with synthetic materials, you can opt for something fireproof for extra peace of mind.
