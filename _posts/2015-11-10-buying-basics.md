# Tipi buying basics

Buying is most economical for those looking for either a professional tent style tipi that can sleep up to 10 people and have a fire inside, or those looking for something very small as a novelty or possibly a kids item.

By far my favorite professional tipi is the [Tentipi Zircon 9](http://amzn.to/1HZgMmL) which sleeps 9 people and can be used with a small fire inside or a wood burning stove.
